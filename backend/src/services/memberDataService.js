/**
 * Handles the upload of member images using Multer.
 *
 * **Important:** When using `uploadMemberImage`, wrap its invocation inside a Promise in your controller function to ensure proper asynchronous handling. This prevents the parent function from mistakenly believing the file upload failed even if it was successful.
 *
 * **Example Usage in Controller:**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * export async function uploadMemberImageController(req, res) {
 *   try {
 *     await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
 *       uploadMemberImage(req, res, (err) => {
 *         if (err) {
 *           reject(err);
 *         } else {
 *           resolve();
 *         }
 *       });
 *     });
 *
 *     if (!req.file) {
 *       throw new Error('No file uploaded');
 *     }
 *
 *     res.status(200).json({
 *       success: true,
 *       file: `/memberImage/${req.file.filename}`,
 *     });
 *   } catch (err) {
 *     if (res.headersSent) return;
 *     res.status(400).json({
 *       success: false,
 *       message: err.message,
 *     });
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Posting Instructions:**
 *
 * 1. **HTTP Method:** `POST`
 * 2. **URL:** Set to the correct endpoint.
 * 3. **Body:** Use `form-data`.
 *    - Key: `image` (this is the field name that Multer expects)
 *    - Type: **File**
 *    - Value: Select the file you want to upload.
 *
 * **Programmatic Example (JavaScript Fetch API):**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const formData = new FormData();
 * formData.append('image', fileInput.files[0]); // 'image' matches the field name
 *
 * fetch('http://localhost:3000/your-endpoint', {
 *   method: 'POST',
 *   body: formData,
 * })
 *   .then(response => response.json())
 *   .then(data => console.log(data))
 *   .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** In this example, `fileInput` represents the file input field in a form.
 *
 * **Description:**
 *
 * `uploadMemberImage` configures Multer to handle image uploads, storing files in the `memberImage/` directory. Only files submitted under the field name `'image'` are accepted.
 *
 * @throws Error if the upload is unsuccessful.
